# Darky-Supermarket Analysis 
Darky Supermarket operates a network of supermarkets spanning across various locations. The objective of this project is to analyze the Darky Supermarket dataset, 
gain insights and give recommendations with the goal of increasing sales.

This repository contains the steps involved in data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, insights, recommendations and conclusion.

This project was the capstone project for Her Tech Trail Data Analyst Pro Track and I was able to explore my skills in using Python for exploratory data analysis as well as data visualization.
