# Darky-Supermarket Analysis 
Darky Supermarket is a chain of supermarkets with branches in various Supermarkets. The objective of this project is to analyze the Darky Supermarket dataset, 
gain insights and give recommendations with the goal of increasing sales and improving revenue.

This project was the capstone project for Her Tech Trail Data Analyst Pro Track and I was able to explore my skills in using Python for exploratory 
data analysis as well as data visualization.
